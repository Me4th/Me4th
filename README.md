# Hi, i am Michael 🤟

My name is Michael Amting and I am a web developer from Bonn in Germany 🇩🇪 I am employed at Pressmind GmbH in Schmallenberg. If you are a tour operator, definitely <a href="https://github.com/pressmind/wp-travelshop-theme">check out the travelshop theme</a>.

My focus is frontend development with a lot of javascript and of course HTML5 / SCSS. But I also have basic knowledge in PHP and development with Node.js. In my free time I dance Tango Argentino for balance. I have a son (Mika) who is 5 years old and who keeps me busy after a week at work.

I ❤️ working with Vue.js

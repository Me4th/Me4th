My focus is frontend development with a lot of javascript and of course HTML5 / SCSS. But I also have basic knowledge in PHP and development with Node.js. In my free time I dance Tango Argentino for balance. I have a son (Mika) who is 5 years old and who keeps me busy after a week at work.

I ❤️ working with Vue.js
